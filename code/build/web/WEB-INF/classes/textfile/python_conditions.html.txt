Else ❮ Previous Next ❯ Python Conditions and If statements Python supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics: Equals: a == b Not Equals: a != b Less than: a < b Less than or equal to: a <= b Greater than: a > b Greater than or equal to: a >= b These conditions can be used in several ways, most commonly in "if statements" and loops. An "if statement" is written by using the if keyword. Example If statement: a = 33 b = 200 if b > a: print("b is greater than a") Run example » In this example we use two variables, a and b, which are used as part of the if statement to test whether b is greater than a. As a is 33, and b is 200, we know that 200 is greater than 33, and so we print to screen that "b is greater than a". Indentation Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope in the code. Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose. Example If statement, without indentation (will raise an error): a = 33 b = 200 if b > a: print("b is greater than a") # you will get an error Run example » Elif The elif keyword is pythons way of saying "if the previous conditions were not true, then try this condition". Example a = 33 b = 33 if b > a: print("b is greater than a") elif a == b: print("a and b are equal") Run example » In this example a is equal to b, so the first condition is not true, but the elif condition is true, so we print to screen that "a and b are equal". Else The else keyword catches anything which isn't caught by the preceding conditions. Example a = 200 b = 33 if b > a: print("b is greater than a") elif a == b: print("a and b are equal") else: print("a is greater than b") Run example » In this example a is greater to b, so the first condition is not true, also the elif condition is not true, so we go to the else condition and print to screen that "a is greater than b". You can also have an else without the elif: Example a = 200 b = 33 if b > a: print("b is greater than a") else: print("b is not greater than a") Run example » Short Hand If If you have only one statement to execute, you can put it on the same line as the if statement. Example One line if statement: if a > b: print("a is greater than b") Run example » Short Hand If ... Else If you have only one statement to execute, one for if, and one for else, you can put it all on the same line: Example One line if else statement: print("A") if a > b else print("B") Run example » You can also have multiple else statements on the same line: Example One line if else statement, with 3 conditions: print("A") if a > b else print("=") if a == b else print("B") Run example » And The and keyword is a logical operator, and is used to combine conditional statements: Example Test if a is greater than b, AND if c is greater than a: if a > b and c > a: print("Both conditions are True") Run example » Or The or keyword is a logical operator, and is used to combine conditional statements: Example Test if a is greater than b, OR if a is greater than c: if a > b or a > c: print("At least one of the conditions are True") Run example » Test Yourself With Exercises Exercise: Print "Hello World if a is greater than b. 
a = 50
b = 10
 a  b
  print("Hello World")
