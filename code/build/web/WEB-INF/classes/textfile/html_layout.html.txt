Footer Try it Yourself » HTML Layout Elements Websites often display content in multiple columns (like a magazine or newspaper). HTML5 offers new semantic elements that define the different parts of a web page: <header> - Defines a header for a document or a section <nav> - Defines a container for navigation links <section> - Defines a section in a document <article> - Defines an independent self-contained article <aside> - Defines content aside from the content (like a sidebar) <footer> - Defines a footer for a document or a section <details> - Defines additional details <summary> - Defines a heading for the <details> element HTML Layout Techniques There are five different ways to create multicolumn layouts. Each way has its pros and cons: HTML tables (not recommended) CSS float property CSS flexbox CSS framework CSS grid Which One to Choose? HTML Tables The <table> element was not designed to be a layout tool! The purpose of the <table> element is to display tabular data. So, do not use tables for your page layout! They will bring a mess into your code. And imagine how hard it will be to redesign your site after a couple of months. Tip: Do NOT use tables for your page layout! CSS Frameworks If you want to create your layout fast, you can use a framework, like W3.CSS or Bootstrap. CSS Floats It is common to do entire web layouts using the CSS float property. Float is easy to learn - you just need to remember how the float and clear properties work. Disadvantages: Floating elements are tied to the document flow, which may harm the flexibility.
