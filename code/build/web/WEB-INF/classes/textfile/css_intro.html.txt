CSS is used to define styles for your web pages, including the design, layout and variations in display for different devices and screen sizes. CSS Solved a Big Problem HTML was NEVER intended to contain tags for formatting a web page! HTML was created to describe the content of a web page, like: <h1>This is a heading</h1> <p>This is a paragraph.</p> When tags like <font>, and color attributes were added to the HTML 3.2 specification, it started a nightmare for web developers. Development of large websites, where fonts and color information were added to every single page, became a long and expensive process. To solve this problem, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) created CSS. CSS removed the style formatting from the HTML page! CSS Saves a Lot of Work!
