The system is designed to make it easier to select HTML colors. NCol specifies colors using a color letter with a number to specify the distance (in percent) from the color. R30 means 30% away from Red , moving towards Yellow. (In other words: Red with 30% Yellow) Letter Color Hues R Red R R25 R50 R75 Y Yellow Y Y25 Y50 Y75 G Green G G25 G50 G75 C Cyan C C25 C50 C75 B Blue B B25 B50 B75 M Magenta M M25 M50 M75 R Y G C B M Color and distance can also be given in hues (0-360): R = 000 Y = 060 G = 120 C = 180 B = 240 M = 300 HTML Support NCol is not supported in HTML (yet), but it is very close to the new HWB color system suggested in CSS4. While waiting for CSS4, you can include W3Schools' Color library, and use NCol as an HTML attribute like this: Example <div data-w3-color="R50,50%,0"> <p>London is the capital city of England. It is the most populous city in the United Kingdom, with a metropolitan area of over 13 million inhabitants.</p> </div> <script src="/lib/w3color.js"></script> Try It Yourself » W3Schools Color Library The JavaScript library used in the example above can be downloaded from https://www.w3schools.com/lib/w3color.js Why NCol? Trying to explain colors using RGB or HEX notation is very difficult. Can you tell what color rgb(199,21,133) is? RGB is based on how to physically produce colors by mixing light sources. NCol is based on what colors look like to the human eye. Because of this, NCol makes it much easier to describe colors. Natural colors were first described by Karl Ewald Konstantin Hering (Germany 1834 - 1918). ❮ Previous Next ❯ COLOR PICKER HOW TO Tabs Dropdowns Accordions Side Navigation Top Navigation Modal Boxes Progress Bars Parallax Login Form HTML Includes Google Maps Range Sliders Tooltips Slideshow Filter List Sort List SHARE CERTIFICATES HTML CSS JavaScript PHP jQuery Bootstrap XML Read More » REPORT ERROR PRINT PAGE FORUM ABOUT × Your Suggestion: Your E-mail: Page address: Description: Submit × Thank You For Helping Us!
