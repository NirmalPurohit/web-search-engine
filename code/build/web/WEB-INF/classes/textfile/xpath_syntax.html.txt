The node is selected by following a path or steps. The XML Example Document We will use the following XML document in the examples below. <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?> <bookstore> <book> <title lang="en">Harry Potter</title> <price>29.99</price> </book> <book> <title lang="en">Learning XML</title> <price>39.95</price> </book> </bookstore> Selecting Nodes XPath uses path expressions to select nodes in an XML document. The node is selected by following a path or steps. The most useful path expressions are listed below: Expression Description nodename Selects all nodes with the name "nodename" / Selects from the root node // Selects nodes in the document from the current node that match the selection no matter where they are . Selects the current node .. Selects the parent of the current node @ Selects attributes In the table below we have listed some path expressions and the result of the expressions: Path Expression Result bookstore Selects all nodes with the name "bookstore" /bookstore Selects the root element bookstore Note: If the path starts with a slash ( / ) it always represents an absolute path to an element! bookstore/book Selects all book elements that are children of bookstore //book Selects all book elements no matter where they are in the document bookstore//book Selects all book elements that are descendant of the bookstore element, no matter where they are under the bookstore element //@lang Selects all attributes that are named lang Predicates Predicates are used to find a specific node or a node that contains a specific value. Predicates are always embedded in square brackets. In the table below we have listed some path expressions with predicates and the result of the expressions: Path Expression Result /bookstore/book[1] Selects the first book element that is the child of the bookstore element. Note: In IE 5,6,7,8,9 first node is[0], but according to W3C, it is [1]. To solve this problem in IE, set the SelectionLanguage to XPath: In JavaScript: xml.setProperty("SelectionLanguage","XPath"); /bookstore/book[last()] Selects the last book element that is the child of the bookstore element /bookstore/book[last()-1] Selects the last but one book element that is the child of the bookstore element /bookstore/book[position()<3] Selects the first two book elements that are children of the bookstore element //title[@lang] Selects all the title elements that have an attribute named lang //title[@lang='en'] Selects all the title elements that have a "lang" attribute with a value of "en" /bookstore/book[price>35.00] Selects all the book elements of the bookstore element that have a price element with a value greater than 35.00 /bookstore/book[price>35.00]/title Selects all the title elements of the book elements of the bookstore element that have a price element with a value greater than 35.00 Selecting Unknown Nodes XPath wildcards can be used to select unknown XML nodes. Wildcard Description * Matches any element node @* Matches any attribute node node() Matches any node of any kind In the table below we have listed some path expressions and the result of the expressions: Path Expression Result /bookstore/* Selects all the child element nodes of the bookstore element //* Selects all elements in the document //title[@*] Selects all title elements which have at least one attribute of any kind Selecting Several Paths By using the | operator in an XPath expression you can select several paths. In the table below we have listed some path expressions and the result of the expressions: Path Expression Result //book/title | //book/price Selects all the title AND price elements of all book elements //title | //price Selects all the title AND price elements in the document /bookstore/book/title | //price Selects all the title elements of the book element of the bookstore element AND all the price elements in the document ❮ Previous Next ❯ COLOR PICKER HOW TO Tabs Dropdowns Accordions Side Navigation Top Navigation Modal Boxes Progress Bars Parallax Login Form HTML Includes Google Maps Range Sliders Tooltips Slideshow Filter List Sort List SHARE CERTIFICATES HTML CSS JavaScript PHP jQuery Bootstrap XML Read More » REPORT ERROR PRINT PAGE FORUM ABOUT × Your Suggestion: Your E-mail: Page address: Description: Submit × Thank You For Helping Us!
