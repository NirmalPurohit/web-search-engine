In VBScript we have four looping statements: For...Next statement - runs code a specified number of times For Each...Next statement - runs code for each item in a collection or each element of an array Do...Loop statement - loops while or until a condition is true While...Wend statement - Do not use it - use the Do...Loop statement instead For...Next Loop Use the For...Next statement to run a block of code a specified number of times. The For statement specifies the counter variable (i), and its start and end values. The Next statement increases the counter variable (i) by one. Example <html> <body> <% For i = 0 To 5 response.write("The number is " & i & "<br />") Next %> </body> </html> Show Example » The Step Keyword With the Step keyword, you can increase or decrease the counter variable by the value you specify. In the example below, the counter variable (i) is INCREASED by two, each time the loop repeats. For i=2 To 10 Step 2 some code Next To decrease the counter variable, you must use a negative Step value. You must specify an end value that is less than the start value. In the example below, the counter variable (i) is DECREASED by two, each time the loop repeats. For i=10 To 2 Step -2 some code Next Exit a For...Next You can exit a For...Next statement with the Exit For keyword. For i=1 To 10 If i=5 Then Exit For some code Next For Each...Next Loop A For Each...Next loop repeats a block of code for each item in a collection, or for each element of an array. Example <html> <body> <% Dim cars(2) cars(0)="Volvo" cars(1)="Saab" cars(2)="BMW" For Each x In cars response.write(x & "<br />") Next %> </body> </html> Show Example » Do...Loop If you don't know how many repetitions you want, use a Do...Loop statement. The Do...Loop statement repeats a block of code while a condition is true, or until a condition becomes true. Repeat Code While a Condition is True You use the While keyword to check a condition in a Do...Loop statement. Do While i>10 some code Loop If i equals 9, the code inside the loop above will never be executed. Do some code Loop While i>10 The code inside this loop will be executed at least one time, even if i is less than 10. Repeat Code Until a Condition Becomes True You use the Until keyword to check a condition in a Do...Loop statement. Do Until i=10 some code Loop If i equals 10, the code inside the loop will never be executed. Do some code Loop Until i=10 The code inside this loop will be executed at least one time, even if i is equal to 10. Exit a Do...Loop You can exit a Do...Loop statement with the Exit Do keyword. Do Until i=10 i=i-1 If i<10 Then Exit Do Loop The code inside this loop will be executed as long as i is different from 10, and as long as i is greater than 10.
