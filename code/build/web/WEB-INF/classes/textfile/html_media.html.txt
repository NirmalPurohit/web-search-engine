What is Multimedia? Multimedia comes in many different formats. It can be almost anything you can hear or see. Examples: Images, music, sound, videos, records, films, animations, and more. Web pages often contain multimedia elements of different types and formats. In this chapter you will learn about the different multimedia formats. Browser Support The first web browsers had support for text only, limited to a single font in a single color. Later came browsers with support for colors and fonts, and images! Audio, video, and animation have been handled differently by the major browsers. Different formats have been supported, and some formats require extra helper programs (plug-ins) to work. Hopefully this will become history. HTML5 multimedia promises an easier future for multimedia. Multimedia Formats Multimedia elements (like audio or video) are stored in media files.
