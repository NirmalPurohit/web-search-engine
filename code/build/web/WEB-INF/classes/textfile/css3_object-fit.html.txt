Browser Support The numbers in the table specify the first browser version that fully supports the property. Property object-fit 31.0 16.0 36.0 7.1 19.0 The CSS object-fit Property The CSS object-fit property is used to specify how an <img> or <video> should be resized to fit its container. This property tells the content to fill the container in a variety of ways; such as "preserve that aspect ratio" or "stretch up and take up as much space as possible". Look at the following image from Paris, which is 400x300 pixels: However, if we style the image above to be 200x400 pixels, it will look like this: Example img { width: 200px; height: 400px; } Try it Yourself » We see that the image is being squeezed to fit the container of 200x400 pixels, and its original aspect ratio is destroyed. If we use object-fit: cover; it will cut off the sides of the image, preserving the aspect ratio, and also filling in the space, like this: Example img { width: 200px; height: 400px; object-fit: cover; } Try it Yourself » Another Example Here we have two images and we want them to fill the width of 50% of the browser window and 100% of the height. In the following example we do NOT use object-fit, so when we resize the browser window, the aspect ratio of the images will be destroyed: Example Try it Yourself » In the next example, we use object-fit: cover;, so when we resize the browser window, the aspect ratio of the images is preserved: Example Try it Yourself » All Values of The CSS object-fit Property The object-fit property can have the following values: fill - This is default. The replaced content is sized to fill the element's content box. If necessary, the object will be stretched or squished to fit contain - The replaced content is scaled to maintain its aspect ratio while fitting within the element's content box cover - The replaced content is sized to maintain its aspect ratio while filling the element's entire content box. The object will be clipped to fit none - The replaced content is not resized scale-down - The content is sized as if none or contain were specified (would result in a smaller concrete object size) The following example demonstrates all the possible values of the object-fit property: Example .fill {object-fit: fill;} .contain {object-fit: contain;} .cover {object-fit: cover;} .scale-down {object-fit: scale-down;} .none {object-fit: none;} Try it Yourself » ❮ Previous Next ❯ COLOR PICKER HOW TO Tabs Dropdowns Accordions Side Navigation Top Navigation Modal Boxes Progress Bars Parallax Login Form HTML Includes Google Maps Range Sliders Tooltips Slideshow Filter List Sort List SHARE CERTIFICATES HTML CSS JavaScript PHP jQuery Bootstrap XML Read More » REPORT ERROR PRINT PAGE FORUM ABOUT × Your Suggestion: Your E-mail: Page address: Description: Submit × Thank You For Helping Us!
