JavaScript Strings A JavaScript string is zero or more characters written inside quotes. Example var x = "John Doe"; Try it Yourself » You can use single or double quotes: Example var carname = "Volvo XC60"; // Double quotes var carname = 'Volvo XC60'; // Single quotes Try it Yourself » You can use quotes inside a string, as long as they don't match the quotes surrounding the string: Example var answer = "It's alright"; var answer = "He is called 'Johnny'"; var answer = 'He is called "Johnny"'; Try it Yourself » String Length The length of a string is found in the built in property length: Example var txt = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"; var sln = txt.length; Try it Yourself » Special Characters Because strings must be written within quotes, JavaScript will misunderstand this string: var x = "We are the so-called "Vikings" from the north."; The string will be chopped to "We are the so-called ". The solution to avoid this problem, is to use the backslash escape character. The backslash (\) escape character turns special characters into string characters: Code Result Description \' ' Single quote \" " Double quote \\ \ Backslash The sequence \" inserts a double quote in a string: Example var x = "We are the so-called \"Vikings\" from the north."; Try it Yourself » The sequence \' inserts a single quote in a string: Example var x = 'It\'s alright.'; Try it Yourself » The sequence \\ inserts a backslash in a string: Example var x = "The character \\ is called backslash."; Try it Yourself » Six other escape sequences are valid in JavaScript: Code Result \b Backspace \f Form Feed \n New Line \r Carriage Return \t Horizontal Tabulator \v Vertical Tabulator The 6 escape characters above were originally designed to control typewriters, teletypes, and fax machines. They do not make any sense in HTML. Breaking Long Code Lines For best readability, programmers often like to avoid code lines longer than 80 characters. If a JavaScript statement does not fit on one line, the best place to break it is after an operator: Example document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello Dolly!"; Try it Yourself » You can also break up a code line within a text string with a single backslash: Example document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello \ Dolly!"; Try it Yourself » The \ method is not the preferred method. It might not have universal support. Some browsers do not allow spaces behind the \ character. A safer way to break up a string, is to use string addition: Example document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello " + "Dolly!"; Try it Yourself » You cannot break up a code line with a backslash: Example document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = \ "Hello Dolly!"; Try it Yourself » Strings Can be Objects Normally, JavaScript strings are primitive values, created from literals: var firstName = "John"; But strings can also be defined as objects with the keyword new: var firstName = new String("John"); Example var x = "John"; var y = new String("John"); // typeof x will return string // typeof y will return object Try it Yourself » Don't create strings as objects. It slows down execution speed. The new keyword complicates the code. This can produce some unexpected results: When using the == operator, equal strings are equal: Example var x = "John"; var y = new String("John"); // (x == y) is true because x and y have equal values Try it Yourself » When using the === operator, equal strings are not equal, because the === operator expects equality in both type and value. Example var x = "John"; var y = new String("John"); // (x === y) is false because x and y have different types (string and object) Try it Yourself » Or even worse. Objects cannot be compared: Example var x = new String("John"); var y = new String("John"); // (x == y) is false because x and y are different objects Try it Yourself » Example var x = new String("John"); var y = new String("John"); // (x === y) is false because x and y are different objects Try it Yourself » Note the difference between (x==y) and (x===y). Comparing two JavaScript objects will always return false. Test Yourself with Exercises!
