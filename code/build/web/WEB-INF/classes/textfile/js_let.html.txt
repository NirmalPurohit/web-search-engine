These two keywords provide Block Scope variables (and constants) in JavaScript. Before ES2015, JavaScript had only two types of scope: Global Scope and Function Scope. Global Scope Variables declared Globally (outside any function) have Global Scope. Example var carName = "Volvo"; // code here can use carName function myFunction() { // code here can also use carName } Try it Yourself » Global variables can be accessed from anywhere in a JavaScript program. Function Scope Variables declared Locally (inside a function) have Function Scope. Example // code here can NOT use carName function myFunction() { var carName = "Volvo"; // code here CAN use carName } // code here can NOT use carName Try it Yourself » Local variables can only be accessed from inside the function where they are declared. JavaScript Block Scope Variables declared with the var keyword can not have Block Scope. Variables declared inside a block {} can be accessed from outside the block. Example { var x = 2; } // x CAN be used here Before ES2015 JavaScript did not have Block Scope. Variables declared with the let keyword can have Block Scope. Variables declared inside a block {} can not be accessed from outside the block: Example { let x = 2; } // x can NOT be used here Redeclaring Variables Redeclaring a variable using the var keyword can impose problems. Redeclaring a variable inside a block will also redeclare the variable outside the block: Example var x = 10; // Here x is 10 { var x = 2; // Here x is 2 } // Here x is 2 Try it Yourself » Redeclaring a variable using the let keyword can solve this problem. Redeclaring a variable inside a block will not redeclare the variable outside the block: Example var x = 10; // Here x is 10 { let x = 2; // Here x is 2 } // Here x is 10 Try it Yourself » Browser Support The let keyword is not fully supported in Internet Explorer 11 or earlier. The following table defines the first browser versions with full support for the let keyword: Chrome 49 IE / Edge 12 Firefox 44 Safari 11 Opera 36 Mar, 2016 Jul, 2015 Jan, 2015 Sep, 2017 Mar, 2016 Loop Scope Using var in a loop: Example var i = 5; for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) { // some statements } // Here i is 10 Try it Yourself » Using let in a loop: Example let i = 5; for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) { // some statements } // Here i is 5 Try it Yourself » In the first example, using var, the variable declared in the loop redeclares the variable outside the loop. In the second example, using let, the variable declared in the loop does not redeclare the variable outside the loop. When let is used to declare the i variable in a loop, the i variable will only be visible within the loop. Function Scope Variables declared with var and let are quite similar when declared inside a function. They will both have Function Scope: function myFunction() { var carName = "Volvo"; // Function Scope } function myFunction() { let carName = "Volvo"; // Function Scope } Global Scope Variables declared with var and let are quite similar when declared outside a block. They will both have Global Scope: var x = 2; // Global scope let x = 2; // Global scope Global Variables in HTML With JavaScript, the global scope is the JavaScript environment. In HTML, the global scope is the window object. Global variables defined with the var keyword belong to the window object: Example var carName = "Volvo"; // code here can use window.carName Try it Yourself » Global variables defined with the let keyword do not belong to the window object: Example let carName = "Volvo"; // code here can not use window.carName Try it Yourself » Redeclaring Redeclaring a JavaScript variable with var is allowed anywhere in a program: Example var x = 2; // Now x is 2 var x = 3; // Now x is 3 Try it Yourself » Redeclaring a var variable with let, in the same scope, or in the same block, is not allowed: Example var x = 2; // Allowed let x = 3; // Not allowed { var x = 4; // Allowed let x = 5 // Not allowed } Redeclaring a let variable with let, in the same scope, or in the same block, is not allowed: Example let x = 2; // Allowed let x = 3; // Not allowed { let x = 4; // Allowed let x = 5; // Not allowed } Redeclaring a let variable with var, in the same scope, or in the same block, is not allowed: Example let x = 2; // Allowed var x = 3; // Not allowed { let x = 4; // Allowed var x = 5; // Not allowed } Redeclaring a variable with let, in another scope, or in another block, is allowed: Example let x = 2; // Allowed { let x = 3; // Allowed } { let x = 4; // Allowed } Try it Yourself » Hoisting Variables defined with var are hoisted to the top. (Js Hoisting) You can use a variable before it is declared: Example // you CAN use carName here var carName; Try it Yourself » Variables defined with let are not hoisted to the top. Using a let variable before it is declared will result in a ReferenceError. The variable is in a "temporal dead zone" from the start of the block until it is declared: Example // you can NOT use carName here let carName; ❮ Previous Next ❯ COLOR PICKER HOW TO Tabs Dropdowns Accordions Side Navigation Top Navigation Modal Boxes Progress Bars Parallax Login Form HTML Includes Google Maps Range Sliders Tooltips Slideshow Filter List Sort List SHARE CERTIFICATES HTML CSS JavaScript PHP jQuery Bootstrap XML Read More » REPORT ERROR PRINT PAGE FORUM ABOUT × Your Suggestion: Your E-mail: Page address: Description: Submit × Thank You For Helping Us!
