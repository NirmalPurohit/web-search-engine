Before you start, you shoud have a basic understanding of: What is HTML What is CSS What is DOM What is ES6 What is Node.js What is npm Adding React to an HTML Page This quickstart tutorial will add React to a page like this: Example <!DOCTYPE html> <html lang="en"> <title>Test React</title> <!-- Load React API --> <script src= "https://unpkg.com/react@16/umd/react.production.min.js"></script> <!-- Load React DOM--> <script src= "https://unpkg.com/react-dom@16/umd/react-dom.production.min.js"></script> <!-- Load Babel Compiler --> <script src="https://unpkg.com/babel-standalone@6.15.0/babel.min.js"></script> <body> <script type="text/babel"> // JSX Babel code goes here </script> </body> </html> What is Babel? Babel is a JavaScript compiler that can translate markup or programming languages into JavaScript. With Babel, you can use the newest features of JavaScript (ES6 - ECMAScript 2015). Babel is available for different conversions. React uses Babel to convert JSX into JavaScript. Please note that <script type="text/babel"> is needed for using Babel. What is JSX? JSX stands for JavaScript XML. JSX is an XML/HTML like extension to JavaScript. Example const element = <h1>Hello World!</h1> As you can see above, JSX is not JavaScript nor HTML. JSX is a XML syntax extension to JavaScript that also comes with the full power of ES6 (ECMAScript 2015). Just like HTML, JSX tags can have a tag names, attributes, and children. If an attribute is wrapped in curly braces, the value is a JavaScript expression. Note that JSX does not use quotes around the HTML text string. React DOM Render The method ReactDom.render() is used to render (display) HTML elements: Example <div id="id01">Hello World!</div> <script type="text/babel"> ReactDOM.render( <h1>Hello React!</h1>, document.getElementById('id01')); </script> Try it Yourself » JSX Expressions Expressions can be used in JSX by wrapping them in curly {} braces. Example <div id="id01">Hello World!</div> <script type="text/babel"> const name = 'John Doe'; ReactDOM.render( <h1>Hello {name}!</h1>, document.getElementById('id01')); </script> Try it Yourself » React Elements React applications are usually built around a single HTML element. React developers often call this the root node (root element): <div id="root"></div> React elements look like this: const element = <h1>Hello React!</h1> Elements are rendered (displayed) withe the ReactDOM.render() method: ReactDOM.render(element, document.getElementById('root')); Try it Yourself » React elements are immutable. They cannot be changed. The only way to change a React element is to render a new element every time: Example function tick() { const element = (<h1>{new Date().toLocaleTimeString()}</h1>); ReactDOM.render(element, document.getElementById('root')); } setInterval(tick, 1000); Try it Yourself » React Components React components are JavaScript functions. This example creates a React component named "Welcome": Example function Welcome() { return <h1>Hello React!</h1>; } ReactDOM.render(<Welcome />, document.getElementById('root')); Try it Yourself » React can also use ES6 classes to create components. This example creates a React component named Welcome with a render method: Example class Welcome extends React.Component { render() { return(<h1>Hello React!</h1>); } } ReactDOM.render(<Welcome />, document.getElementById('root')); Try it Yourself » React Component Properties This example creates a React component named "Welcome" with property aguments: Example function Welcome(props) { return <h1>Hello {props.name}!</h1>; } ReactDOM.render(<Welcome name="John Doe"/>, document.getElementById('root')); Try it Yourself » React can also use ES6 classes to create components. This example also creates a React component named "Welcome" with property arguments: Example class Welcome extends React.Component { render() { return(<h1>Hello {this.props.name}</h1>); } } ReactDOM.render(<Welcome name="John Doe"/>, document.getElementById('root')); Try it Yourself » JSX Compiler The examples on this page compiles JSX in the browser. For production code, the compilation should be done separately. Create React Application Facebook has created a Create React Application with everything you need to build a React app. It is a a development server that uses Webpack to compile React, JSX, and ES6, auto-prefix CSS files. The Create React App uses ESLint to test and warn about mistakes in the code. To create a Create React App run the following code on your terminal: Example npx create-react-app react-tutorial Make sure you have Node.js 5.2 or higher. Otherwise you must install npx: Example npm i npx Start one folder up from where you want your application to stay: Example C:\Users\myUser>npx create-react-app react-tutorial Success Result: npx: installed 63 in 10.359s Creating a new React app in C:\Users\myUser\react-tutorial. Installing packages. This might take a couple of minutes. Installing react, react-dom, and react-scripts... + react-dom@16.5.2 + react@16.5.2 + react-scripts@2.0.4 added 1732 packages from 664 contributors and audited 31900 packages in 355.501s found 0 vulnerabilities+ react@16.5.2 Success! Created react-tutorial at C:\Users\myUser\react-tutorial Inside that directory, you can run several commands: npm start Starts the development server. npm run build Bundles the app into static files for production. npm test Starts the test runner. npm run eject Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you can't go back! We suggest that you begin by typing: cd react-tutorial npm start ❮ Previous Next ❯ COLOR PICKER HOW TO Tabs Dropdowns Accordions Side Navigation Top Navigation Modal Boxes Progress Bars Parallax Login Form HTML Includes Google Maps Range Sliders Tooltips Slideshow Filter List Sort List SHARE CERTIFICATES HTML CSS JavaScript PHP jQuery Bootstrap XML Read More » REPORT ERROR PRINT PAGE FORUM ABOUT × Your Suggestion: Your E-mail: Page address: Description: Submit × Thank You For Helping Us!
