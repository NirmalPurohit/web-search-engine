A CSS pseudo-element is used to style specified parts of an element. For example, it can be used to: Style the first letter, or line, of an element Insert content before, or after, the content of an element Syntax The syntax of pseudo-elements: selector::pseudo-element { property:value; } Notice the double colon notation - ::first-line versus :first-line The double colon replaced the single-colon notation for pseudo-elements in CSS3. This was an attempt from W3C to distinguish between pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements. The single-colon syntax was used for both pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements in CSS2 and CSS1. For backward compatibility, the single-colon syntax is acceptable for CSS2 and CSS1 pseudo-elements. The ::first-line Pseudo-element The ::first-line pseudo-element is used to add a special style to the first line of a text. The following example formats the first line of the text in all <p> elements: Example p::first-line { color: #ff0000; font-variant: small-caps; } Try it Yourself » Note: The ::first-line pseudo-element can only be applied to block-level elements. The following properties apply to the ::first-line pseudo-element: font properties color properties background properties word-spacing letter-spacing text-decoration vertical-align text-transform line-height clear The ::first-letter Pseudo-element The ::first-letter pseudo-element is used to add a special style to the first letter of a text. The following example formats the first letter of the text in all <p> elements: Example p::first-letter { color: #ff0000; font-size: xx-large; } Try it Yourself » Note: The ::first-letter pseudo-element can only be applied to block-level elements. The following properties apply to the ::first-letter pseudo- element: font properties color properties background properties margin properties padding properties border properties text-decoration vertical-align (only if "float" is "none") text-transform line-height float clear Pseudo-elements and CSS Classes Pseudo-elements can be combined with CSS classes: Example p.intro::first-letter { color: #ff0000; font-size:200%; } Try it Yourself » The example above will display the first letter of paragraphs with class="intro", in red and in a larger size. Multiple Pseudo-elements Several pseudo-elements can also be combined. In the following example, the first letter of a paragraph will be red, in an xx-large font size. The rest of the first line will be blue, and in small-caps. The rest of the paragraph will be the default font size and color: Example p::first-letter { color: #ff0000; font-size: xx-large; } p::first-line { color: #0000ff; font-variant: small-caps; } Try it Yourself » CSS - The ::before Pseudo-element The ::before pseudo-element can be used to insert some content before the content of an element. The following example inserts an image before the content of each <h1> element: Example h1::before { content: url(smiley.gif); } Try it Yourself » CSS - The ::after Pseudo-element The ::after pseudo-element can be used to insert some content after the content of an element. The following example inserts an image after the content of each <h1> element: Example h1::after { content: url(smiley.gif); } Try it Yourself » CSS - The ::selection Pseudo-element The ::selection pseudo-element matches the portion of an element that is selected by a user. The following CSS properties can be applied to ::selection: color, background, cursor, and outline. The following example makes the selected text red on a yellow background: Example ::selection { color: red; background: yellow; } Try it Yourself » Test Yourself with Exercises!
