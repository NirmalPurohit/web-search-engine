Python divides the operators in the following groups: Arithmetic operators Assignment operators Comparison operators Logical operators Identity operators Membership operators Bitwise operators Python Arithmetic Operators Arithmetic operators are used with numeric values to perform common mathematical operations: Operator Name Example Try it + Addition x + y Try it » - Subtraction x - y Try it » * Multiplication x * y Try it » / Division x / y Try it » % Modulus x % y Try it » ** Exponentiation x ** y // Floor division x // y Python Assignment Operators Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables: Operator Example Same As Try it = x = 5 x = 5 Try it » += x += 3 x = x + 3 Try it » -= x -= 3 x = x - 3 Try it » *= x *= 3 x = x * 3 Try it » /= x /= 3 x = x / 3 Try it » %= x %= 3 x = x % 3 Try it » //= x //= 3 x = x // 3 Try it » **= x **= 3 x = x ** 3 Try it » &= x &= 3 x = x & 3 Try it » |= x |= 3 x = x | 3 Try it » ^= x ^= 3 x = x ^ 3 Try it » >>= x >>= 3 x = x >> 3 Try it » <<= x <<= 3 x = x << 3 Try it » Python Comparison Operators Comparison operators are used to compare two values: Operator Name Example Try it == Equal x == y Try it » != Not equal x != y Try it » > Greater than x > y Try it » < Less than x < y Try it » >= Greater than or equal to x >= y Try it » <= Less than or equal to x <= y Try it » Python Logical Operators Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements: Operator Description Example Try it and Returns True if both statements are true x < 5 and x < 10 Try it » or Returns True if one of the statements is true x < 5 or x < 4 Try it » not Reverse the result, returns False if the result is true not(x < 5 and x < 10) Try it » Python Identity Operators Identity operators are used to compare the objects, not if they are equal, but if they are actually the same object, with the same memory location: Operator Description Example Try it is Returns true if both variables are the same object x is y Try it » is not Returns true if both variables are not the same object x is not y Try it » Python Membership Operators Membership operators are used to test if a sequence is presented in an object: Operator Description Example Try it in Returns True if a sequence with the specified value is present in the object x in y Try it » not in Returns True if a sequence with the specified value is not present in the object x not in y Try it » Python Bitwise Operators Bitwise operators are used to compare (binary) numbers: Operator Name Description & AND Sets each bit to 1 if both bits are 1 | OR Sets each bit to 1 if one of two bits is 1 ^ XOR Sets each bit to 1 if only one of two bits is 1 ~ NOT Inverts all the bits << Zero fill left shift Shift left by pushing zeros in from the right and let the leftmost bits fall off >> Signed right shift Shift right by pushing copies of the leftmost bit in from the left, and let the rightmost bits fall off Test Yourself With Exercises Exercise: Multiply 10 with 5, and print the result. 
print(10  5)
