JavaScript Loops Loops are handy, if you want to run the same code over and over again, each time with a different value. Often this is the case when working with arrays: Instead of writing: text += cars[0] + "<br>"; text += cars[1] + "<br>"; text += cars[2] + "<br>"; text += cars[3] + "<br>"; text += cars[4] + "<br>"; text += cars[5] + "<br>"; You can write: var i; for (i = 0; i < cars.length; i++) { text += cars[i] + "<br>"; } Try it Yourself » Different Kinds of Loops JavaScript supports different kinds of loops: for - loops through a block of code a number of times for/in - loops through the properties of an object while - loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true do/while - also loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true The For Loop The for loop has the following syntax: for (statement 1; statement 2; statement 3) { code block to be executed } Statement 1 is executed (one time) before the execution of the code block. Statement 2 defines the condition for executing the code block. Statement 3 is executed (every time) after the code block has been executed. Example for (i = 0; i < 5; i++) { text += "The number is " + i + "<br>"; } Try it Yourself » From the example above, you can read: Statement 1 sets a variable before the loop starts (var i = 0). Statement 2 defines the condition for the loop to run (i must be less than 5). Statement 3 increases a value (i++) each time the code block in the loop has been executed. Statement 1 Normally you will use statement 1 to initialize the variable used in the loop (i = 0). This is not always the case, JavaScript doesn't care. Statement 1 is optional. You can initiate many values in statement 1 (separated by comma): Example for (i = 0, len = cars.length, text = ""; i < len; i++) { text += cars[i] + "<br>"; } Try it Yourself » And you can omit statement 1 (like when your values are set before the loop starts): Example var i = 2; var len = cars.length; var text = ""; for (; i < len; i++) { text += cars[i] + "<br>"; } Try it Yourself » Statement 2 Often statement 2 is used to evaluate the condition of the initial variable. This is not always the case, JavaScript doesn't care. Statement 2 is also optional. If statement 2 returns true, the loop will start over again, if it returns false, the loop will end. If you omit statement 2, you must provide a break inside the loop. Otherwise the loop will never end. This will crash your browser. Read about breaks in a later chapter of this tutorial. Statement 3 Often statement 3 increments the value of the initial variable. This is not always the case, JavaScript doesn't care, and statement 3 is optional. Statement 3 can do anything like negative increment (i--), positive increment (i = i + 15), or anything else. Statement 3 can also be omitted (like when you increment your values inside the loop): Example var i = 0; var len = cars.length; for (; i < len; ) { text += cars[i] + "<br>"; i++; } Try it Yourself » The For/In Loop The JavaScript for/in statement loops through the properties of an object: Example var person = {fname:"John", lname:"Doe", age:25}; var text = ""; var x; for (x in person) { text += person[x]; } Try it Yourself » The While Loop The while loop and the do/while loop will be explained in the next chapter.
