In VBScript we have four conditional statements: If statement - executes a set of code when a condition is true If...Then...Else statement - select one of two sets of lines to execute If...Then...ElseIf statement - select one of many sets of lines to execute Select Case statement - select one of many sets of lines to execute If...Then...Else Use the If...Then...Else statement if you want to execute some code if a condition is true select one of two blocks of code to execute If you want to execute only one statement when a condition is true, you can write the code on one line: If i=10 Then response.write("Hello") There is no ..Else.. in this syntax. You just tell the code to perform one action if a condition is true (in this case If i=10). If you want to execute more than one statement when a condition is true, you must put each statement on separate lines, and end the statement with the keyword "End If": If i=10 Then response.write("Hello") i = i+1 End If There is no ..Else.. in the example above either. You just tell the code to perform multiple actions if the condition is true. If you want to execute a statement if a condition is true and execute another statement if the condition is not true, you must add the "Else" keyword: Example i=hour(time) If i < 10 Then response.write("Good morning!") Else response.write("Have a nice day!") End If Show Example » In the example above, the first block of code will be executed if the condition is true, and the other block will be executed otherwise (if i is greater than 10). If...Then...ElseIf You can use the If...Then...ElseIf statement if you want to select one of many blocks of code to execute: Example i=hour(time) If i = 10 Then response.write("Just started...!") ElseIf i = 11 Then response.write("Hungry!") ElseIf i = 12 Then response.write("Ah, lunch-time!") ElseIf i = 16 Then response.write("Time to go home!") Else response.write("Unknown") End If Show Example » Select Case You can also use the "Select Case" statement if you want to select one of many blocks of code to execute: Example d=weekday(date) Select Case d Case 1 response.write("Sleepy Sunday") Case 2 response.write("Monday again!") Case 3 response.write("Just Tuesday!") Case 4 response.write("Wednesday!") Case 5 response.write("Thursday...") Case 6 response.write("Finally Friday!") Case else response.write("Super Saturday!!!!") End Select Show Example » This is how it works: First we have a single expression (most often a variable), that is evaluated once. The value of the expression is then compared with the values for each Case in the structure. If there is a match, the block of code associated with that Case is executed. ❮ Previous Next ❯ COLOR PICKER HOW TO Tabs Dropdowns Accordions Side Navigation Top Navigation Modal Boxes Progress Bars Parallax Login Form HTML Includes Google Maps Range Sliders Tooltips Slideshow Filter List Sort List SHARE CERTIFICATES HTML CSS JavaScript PHP jQuery Bootstrap XML Read More » REPORT ERROR PRINT PAGE FORUM ABOUT × Your Suggestion: Your E-mail: Page address: Description: Submit × Thank You For Helping Us!
