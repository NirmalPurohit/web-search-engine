In Java, there are different types of variables, for example: String - stores text, such as "Hello". String values are surrounded by double quotes int - stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals, such as 123 or -123 float - stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99 char - stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Char values are surrounded by single quotes boolean - stores values with two states: true or false Declaring (Creating) Variables To create a variable, you must specify the type and assign it a value: Syntax type variable = value; Where type is one of Java's types (such as int or String), and variable is the name of the variable (such as x or name). The equal sign is used to assign values to the variable. To create a variable that should store text, look at the following example: Example Create a variable called name of type String and assign it the value "John": String name = "John"; System.out.println(name); Run example » To create a variable that should store a number, look at the following example: Example Create a variable called myNum of type int and assign it the value 15: int myNum = 15; System.out.println(myNum); Run example » You can also declare a variable without assigning the value, and assign the value later: Example int myNum; myNum = 15; System.out.println(myNum); Run example » A demonstration of how to declare variables of other types: Example int myNum = 5; float myFloatNum = 5.99f; char myLetter = 'D'; boolean myBool = true; String myText = "Hello"; You will learn more about data types in the next chapter. Display Variables The println() method is often used to display variables. To combine both text and a variable, use the + character: Example String name = "John"; System.out.println("Hello " + name); Run example » You can also use the + character to add a variable to another variable: Example String firstName = "John "; String lastName = "Doe"; String fullName = firstName + lastName; System.out.println(fullName); Run example » For numeric values, the + character works as a mathematical operator (notice that we use int (integer) variables here): Example int x = 5; int y = 6; System.out.println(x + y); // Print the value of x + y Run example » From the example above, you can expect: x stores the value 5 y stores the value 6 Then we use the println() method to display the value of x + y, which is 11 Declare Many Variables To declare more than one variable of the same type, use a comma-separated list: Example int x = 5, y = 6, z = 50; System.out.println(x + y + z); Run example » Java Identifiers All Java variables must be identified with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers. Identifiers can be short names (like x and y) or more descriptive names (age, sum, totalVolume). The general rules for constructing names for variables (unique identifiers) are: Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs. Names should begin with a letter Names can also begin with $ and _ (but we will not use it in this tutorial) Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables) Names must start with a lowercase letter and it cannot contain whitespace Reserved words (like Java keywords, such as int or String) cannot be used as names ❮ Previous Next ❯ COLOR PICKER HOW TO Tabs Dropdowns Accordions Side Navigation Top Navigation Modal Boxes Progress Bars Parallax Login Form HTML Includes Google Maps Range Sliders Tooltips Slideshow Filter List Sort List SHARE CERTIFICATES HTML CSS JavaScript PHP jQuery Bootstrap XML Read More » REPORT ERROR PRINT PAGE FORUM ABOUT × Your Suggestion: Your E-mail: Page address: Description: Submit × Thank You For Helping Us!
