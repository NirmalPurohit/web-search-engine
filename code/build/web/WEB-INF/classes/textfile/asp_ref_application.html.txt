The Application object is used to tie these files together. Application Object An application on the Web may consists of several ASP files that work together to perform some purpose. The Application object is used to tie these files together. The Application object is used to store and access variables from any page, just like the Session object. The difference is that ALL users share ONE Application object (with Sessions there is ONE Session object for EACH user). The Application object holds information that will be used by many pages in the application (like database connection information). The information can be accessed from any page. The information can also be changed in one place, and the changes will automatically be reflected on all pages. The Application object's collections, methods, and events are described below: Collections Collection Description Contents Contains all the items appended to the application through a script command StaticObjects Contains all the objects appended to the application with the HTML <object> tag Methods Method Description Contents.Remove Deletes an item from the Contents collection Contents.RemoveAll() Deletes all items from the Contents collection Lock Prevents other users from modifying the variables in the Application object Unlock Enables other users to modify the variables in the Application object (after it has been locked using the Lock method) Events Event Description Application_OnEnd Occurs when all user sessions are over, and the application ends Application_OnStart Occurs before the first new session is created (when the Application object is first referenced) ❮ Previous Next ❯ COLOR PICKER HOW TO Tabs Dropdowns Accordions Side Navigation Top Navigation Modal Boxes Progress Bars Parallax Login Form HTML Includes Google Maps Range Sliders Tooltips Slideshow Filter List Sort List SHARE CERTIFICATES HTML CSS JavaScript PHP jQuery Bootstrap XML Read More » REPORT ERROR PRINT PAGE FORUM ABOUT × Your Suggestion: Your E-mail: Page address: Description: Submit × Thank You For Helping Us!
