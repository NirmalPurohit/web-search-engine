When an error occurs, Java will normally stop and generate an error message. The technical term for this is: Java will throw an exception (throw an error). Java try and catch The try statement allows you to define a block of code to be tested for errors while it is being executed. The catch statement allows you to define a block of code to be executed, if an error occurs in the try block. The try and catch keywords come in pairs: Syntax try { // Block of code to try } catch(Exception e) { // Block of code to handle errors } Consider the following example: This will generate an error, because myNumbers[10] does not exist. public class MyClass { public static void main(String[ ] args) { int[] myNumbers = {1, 2, 3}; System.out.println(myNumbers[10]); } } The output (error) will be something like this: Exception in thread "main" java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: 10 at MyClass.main(MyClass.java:4) Run example » If an error occur, we can use try...catch to catch the error and execute some code to handle it: Example public class MyClass { public static void main(String[ ] args) { try { int[] myNumbers = {1, 2, 3}; System.out.println(myNumbers[10]); } catch (Exception e) { System.out.println("Something went wrong."); } } } The output will be: Something went wrong. Run example » Finally The finally statement lets you execute code, after try...catch, regardless of the result: Example public class MyClass { public static void main(String[] args) { try { int[] myNumbers = {1, 2, 3}; System.out.println(myNumbers[10]); } catch (Exception e) { System.out.println("Something went wrong."); } finally { System.out.println("The 'try catch' is finished."); } } } The output will be: Something went wrong. The 'try catch' is finished. Run example » The throw keyword The throw statement allows you to create a custom error. The throw statement is used together with an exception type. There are many exception types available in Java: ArithmeticException, ClassNotFoundException, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, SecurityException, etc. The exception type is often used together with a custom method. Don't worry if you don't understand the example below, you will learn more about methods in the next chapter: Example Throw an exception if age is below 18 (print "Access denied"). If age is 18 or older, print "Access granted": public class MyClass { static void checkAge(int age) { if(age < 18) { throw new ArithmeticException("Access denied - You must be at least 18 years old."); } else { System.out.println("Access granted - You are old enough!"); } } public static void main(String[] args) { checkAge(15); // Set age to 15 (which is below 18...) } } The output will be: Exception in thread "main" java.lang.ArithmeticException: Access denied - You must be at least 18 years old. at MyClass.checkAge(MyClass.java:4) at MyClass.main(MyClass.java:12) Run example » If age was 20, you would not get an exception: Example checkAge(20); The output will be: Access granted - You are old enough!
