Color theory is a multitude of categories, definitions and concepts. This tutorial covers the parts that are most useful for web design: Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary Colors Color Wheels (RGB, CMY, RYB) Color Hue, Lightness and Saturation The Color of Light Sir Isaac Newton developed the theory that all colors are mixtures of Red, Green, and Blue light. This resulted in the first known color circle in 1666. The Color of Paint In 1766 the scientist Moses Harris created the first color wheel to classify Red, Yellow, and Blue as the primary colors. Moses Harris worked with paint (Newton worked with light) following a theory (by a French painter) that all colors are mixtures of Red, Yellow, and Blue pigments. Color Systems In this tutorial we will cover 3 different color systems: The color system used when producing colors by light (RGB) The color system used when printing (CMY) The color system used by artist and painters (RYB) Printing actually uses a four ink color system. CMYK: Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and Key (black). Primary Colors Primary colors are the main colors in a given color system. Primary colors can not be produced by mixing other colors a color system. The primary colors for light are Red, Green, and Blue: RGB Red Green Blue The primary colors for print are Cyan, Magenta, and Yellow: CMY Cyan Magenta Yellow The primary colors for paint are Red, Yellow, and Blue: RYB Red Yellow Blue Secondary Colors Secondary colors are made by mixing two primary colors in a color system There are 3 secondary colors in the color systems described here. Mixing Light (RGB) Secondary colors are Yellow, Cyan Magenta. Red + Green = Yellow Green + Blue = Cyan Blue + Red = Magenta Mixing Ink (CMY) Secondary colors are Blue, Red, Green. Cyan + Magenta = Blue Magenta + Yellow = Red Yellow + Cyan = Green Note that mixing the primary colors of CMY produces the primary colors of light (RGB) Mixing Paint (RYB) Secondary colors are Orange, Green, Violet. Red + Yellow = Orange Yellow + Blue = Green Blue + Red = Purple Tertiary Colors Tertiary colors are made by mixing one primary and one secondary color in a color system. There are six named tertiary colors in RYB: Red-Orange Yellow-Orange Yellow-Green Blue-Green Blue-Purple Red-Purple ❮ Previous Next ❯ COLOR PICKER HOW TO Tabs Dropdowns Accordions Side Navigation Top Navigation Modal Boxes Progress Bars Parallax Login Form HTML Includes Google Maps Range Sliders Tooltips Slideshow Filter List Sort List SHARE CERTIFICATES HTML CSS JavaScript PHP jQuery Bootstrap XML Read More » REPORT ERROR PRINT PAGE FORUM ABOUT × Your Suggestion: Your E-mail: Page address: Description: Submit × Thank You For Helping Us!
