Links allow users to click their way from page to page. HTML Links - Hyperlinks HTML links are hyperlinks. You can click on a link and jump to another document. When you move the mouse over a link, the mouse arrow will turn into a little hand. Note: A link does not have to be text. It can be an image or any other HTML element. HTML Links - Syntax In HTML, links are defined with the <a> tag: <a href="url">link text</a> Example <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/">Visit our HTML tutorial</a> Try it Yourself » The href attribute specifies the destination address (https://www.w3schools.com/html/) of the link. The link text is the visible part (Visit our HTML tutorial). Clicking on the link text will send you to the specified address. Note: Without a forward slash at the end of subfolder addresses, you might generate two requests to the server. Many servers will automatically add a forward slash to the end of the address, and then create a new request. Local Links The example above used an absolute URL (a full web address). A local link (link to the same web site) is specified with a relative URL (without https://www....). Example <a href="html_images.asp">HTML Images</a> Try it Yourself » HTML Link Colors By default, a link will appear like this (in all browsers): An unvisited link is underlined and blue A visited link is underlined and purple An active link is underlined and red You can change the default colors, by using CSS: Example <style> a:link { color: green; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; } a:visited { color: pink; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; } a:hover { color: red; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: underline; } a:active { color: yellow; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: underline; } </style> Try it Yourself » HTML Links - The target Attribute The target attribute specifies where to open the linked document. The target attribute can have one of the following values: _blank - Opens the linked document in a new window or tab _self - Opens the linked document in the same window/tab as it was clicked (this is default) _parent - Opens the linked document in the parent frame _top - Opens the linked document in the full body of the window framename - Opens the linked document in a named frame This example will open the linked document in a new browser window/tab: Example <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank">Visit W3Schools!</a> Try it Yourself » Tip: If your webpage is locked in a frame, you can use target="_top" to break out of the frame: Example <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/" target="_top">HTML5 tutorial!</a> Try it Yourself » HTML Links - Image as Link It is common to use images as links: Example <a href="default.asp"> <img src="smiley.gif" alt="HTML tutorial" style="width:42px;height:42px;border:0;"> </a> Try it Yourself » Note: border:0; is added to prevent IE9 (and earlier) from displaying a border around the image (when the image is a link). Link Titles The title attribute specifies extra information about an element. The information is most often shown as a tooltip text when the mouse moves over the element. Example <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/" title="Go to W3Schools HTML section">Visit our HTML Tutorial</a> Try it Yourself » HTML Links - Create a Bookmark HTML bookmarks are used to allow readers to jump to specific parts of a Web page. Bookmarks can be useful if your webpage is very long. To make a bookmark, you must first create the bookmark, and then add a link to it. When the link is clicked, the page will scroll to the location with the bookmark. Example First, create a bookmark with the id attribute: <h2 id="C4">Chapter 4</h2> Then, add a link to the bookmark ("Jump to Chapter 4"), from within the same page: <a href="#C4">Jump to Chapter 4</a> Or, add a link to the bookmark ("Jump to Chapter 4"), from another page: Example <a href="html_demo.html#C4">Jump to Chapter 4</a> Try it Yourself » External Paths External pages can be referenced with a full URL or with a path relative to the current web page. This example uses a full URL to link to a web page: Example <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp">HTML tutorial</a> Try it Yourself » This example links to a page located in the html folder on the current web site: Example <a href="/html/default.asp">HTML tutorial</a> Try it Yourself » This example links to a page located in the same folder as the current page: Example <a href="default.asp">HTML tutorial</a> Try it Yourself » You can read more about file paths in the chapter HTML File Paths. Chapter Summary Use the <a> element to define a link Use the href attribute to define the link address Use the target attribute to define where to open the linked document Use the <img> element (inside <a>) to use an image as a link Use the id attribute (id="value") to define bookmarks in a page Use the href attribute (href="#value") to link to the bookmark Test Yourself with Exercises!
