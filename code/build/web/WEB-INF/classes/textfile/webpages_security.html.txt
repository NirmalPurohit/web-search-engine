With the WebSecurity object you can create user accounts, login and logout users, reset or change passwords, and more. WebSecurity Object Reference - Properties Properties Description CurrentUserId Gets the ID for the current user CurrentUserName Gets the name of the current user HasUserId Returns true if the current has a user ID IsAuthenticated Returns true if the current user is logged in WebSecurity Object Reference - Methods Method Description ChangePassword() Changes the password for a user ConfirmAccount() Confirms an account using a confirmation token CreateAccount() Creates a new user account CreateUserAndAccount() Creates a new user account GeneratePasswordResetToken() Generates a token that can be sent to as user by email GetCreateDate() Gets the time the specified membership was created GetPasswordChangeDate() Gets the date and time when password was changed GetUserId() Gets a user ID from a user name InitializeDatabaseConnection() Initializes the WebSecurity system (database) IsConfirmed() Checks if a user is confirmed IsCurrentUser() Checks if the current user matches a user name Login() Logs the user in by setting a token in the cookie Logout() Logs the user out by removing the token cookie RequireAuthenticatedUser() Exits the page if the user is not an authenticated user RequireRoles() Exits the page if the user is not a part of the specified roles RequireUser() Exits the page if the user is not the specified user ResetPassword() Changes a user's password using a token UserExists() Checks if a given user exists Initializing the WebSecurity Database You must create or initialize an WebSecurity database before you can use the WebSecurity object in your code. In the root of your web, create a page (or edit the page ) named _AppStart.cshtml. Put the following code inside the file: _AppStart.cshtml @{ WebSecurity.InitializeDatabaseConnection("Users", "UserProfile", "UserId", "Email", true); } The code above will run each time the web site (application) starts. It initializes the WebSecurity database. "Users" is the name of the WebSecurity database (Users.sdf). "UserProfile" is the name of the database table that contains the user profile information. "UserId" is the name of the column that contains the user IDs (primary key). "Email" is the name of the column that contains user names. The last parameter true is a boolean value indicating that the user profile and membership tables should be created automatically if they don't exist, otherwise false. Although true indicates automatic creation of the database tables, the database itself will not be created automatically. It must exist. The WebSecurity Database The UserProfile table contains one record for each user, with a user ID (primary key) and the user's name (email): UserId Email 1 john@johnson.net 2 peter@peterson.com 3 lars@larson.eut The Membership table will contain membership information about when the user was created and if (and when) the membership was confirmed. Much like this (some columns are not shown): User Id Create Date Confirmation Token Is Confirmed Last Password Failure Password Password Change 1 12.04.2012 16:12:17 NULL True NULL AFNQhWfy.... 12.04.2012 16:12:17 Simple Membership Configuration You might get errors using the WebSecurity object, if your site is not configured to use the ASP.NET Web Pages membership system SimpleMembership. This can occur if a hosting provider's server is configured differently than your local server. To fix this, add the following element to the site's Web.config file: <appSettings> <add key="enableSimpleMembership" value="true" /> </appSettings> ❮ Previous Next ❯ COLOR PICKER HOW TO Tabs Dropdowns Accordions Side Navigation Top Navigation Modal Boxes Progress Bars Parallax Login Form HTML Includes Google Maps Range Sliders Tooltips Slideshow Filter List Sort List SHARE CERTIFICATES HTML CSS JavaScript PHP jQuery Bootstrap XML Read More » REPORT ERROR PRINT PAGE FORUM ABOUT × Your Suggestion: Your E-mail: Page address: Description: Submit × Thank You For Helping Us!
