JavaScript variables can be: Numbers Strings Objects Arrays Functions JavaScript Variables JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values. In this example, x, y, and z, are variables: Example var x = 5; var y = 6; var z = x + y; Try it Yourself » From the example above, you can expect: x stores the value 5 y stores the value 6 z stores the value 11 JavaScript Numbers JavaScript has only one type of number. Numbers can be written with or without decimals. Example var x = 3.14; // A number with decimals var y = 3; // A number without decimals Try it yourself » All numbers are stored as double precision floating point numbers. The maximum number of decimals is 17, but floating point is not always 100% accurate: Example var x = 0.2 + 0.1; // x will be 0.30000000000000004 Try it yourself » JavaScript Strings Strings store text. Strings are written inside quotes. You can use single or double quotes: Example var carname = "Volvo XC60"; // Double quotes var carname = 'Volvo XC60'; // Single quotes Try it Yourself » The length of a string is found in the built in property length: Example var txt = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"; var sln = txt.length; Try it Yourself » JavaScript Objects You have already learned that JavaScript variables are containers for data values. This code assigns a simple value (Fiat) to a variable named car: var car = "Fiat"; Try it Yourself » Objects are variables too. But objects can contain many values. This code assigns many values (Fiat, 500, white) to a variable named car: var car = {type:"Fiat", model:"500", color:"white"}; Try it Yourself » JavaScript Arrays JavaScript arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable. Example var cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"]; Try it Yourself » JavaScript Functions A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task. A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it). Example function myFunction(p1, p2) { return p1 * p2; // The function returns the product of p1 and p2 } Try it Yourself » What can JavaScript Do? This section contains some examples of what JavaScript can do: JavaScript Can Change HTML Content JavaScript Can Change HTML Attribute Values JavaScript Can Change HTML Styles CSS) JavaScript Can Hide HTML Elements JavaScript Can Show HTML Elements JavaScript Can Change HTML Content One of many JavaScript HTML methods is getElementById(). This example uses the method to "find" an HTML element (with id="demo") and changes the element content (innerHTML) to "Hello JavaScript": Example document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello JavaScript"; Try it Yourself » JavaScript Can Change HTML Attribute Values In this example JavaScript changes the value of the src (source) attribute of an <img> tag: The Light Bulb Turn on the light Turn off the light Try it Yourself » JavaScript Can Change HTML Styles (CSS) Changing the style of an HTML element, is a variant of changing an HTML attribute: Example document.getElementById("demo").style.fontSize = "35px"; or document.getElementById('demo').style.fontSize = '35px'; Try it Yourself » JavaScript Can Hide HTML Elements Hiding HTML elements can be done by changing the display style: Example document.getElementById("demo").style.display = "none"; or document.getElementById('demo').style.display = 'none'; Try it Yourself » JavaScript Can Show HTML Elements Showing hidden HTML elements can also be done by changing the display style: Example document.getElementById("demo").style.display = "block"; or document.getElementById('demo').style.display = 'block'; Try it Yourself » Full JavaScript Tutorial This has been a short description of JavaScript.
