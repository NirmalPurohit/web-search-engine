More Examples A form with method="get" How to interact with the user, with the Request.QueryString command. A form with method="post" How to interact with the user, with the Request.Form command. A form with radio buttons How to interact with the user, through radio buttons, with the Request.Form command. User Input The Request object can be used to retrieve user information from forms. User input can be retrieved with the Request.QueryString or Request.Form command. Request.QueryString The Request.QueryString command is used to collect values in a form with method="get". Information sent from a form with the GET method is visible to everyone (it will be displayed in the browser's address bar) and has limits on the amount of information to send. Example HTML form <form method="get" action="simpleform.asp"> First Name: <input type="text" name="fname"><br> Last Name: <input type="text" name="lname"><br><br> <input type="submit" value="Submit"> </form> If a user typed "Bill" and "Gates" in the HTML form above, the URL sent to the server would look like this: https://www.w3schools.com/simpleform.asp?fname=Bill&lname=Gates Assume that "simpleform.asp" contains the following ASP script: <body> Welcome <% response.write(request.querystring("fname")) response.write(" " & request.querystring("lname")) %> </body> The browser will display the following in the body of the document: Welcome Bill Gates Request.Form The Request.Form command is used to collect values in a form with method="post". Information sent from a form with the POST method is invisible to others and has no limits on the amount of information to send. Example HTML form <form method="post" action="simpleform.asp"> First Name: <input type="text" name="fname"><br> Last Name: <input type="text" name="lname"><br><br> <input type="submit" value="Submit"> </form> If a user typed "Bill" and "Gates" in the HTML form above, the URL sent to the server would look like this: https://www.w3schools.com/simpleform.asp Assume that "simpleform.asp" contains the following ASP script: <body> Welcome <% response.write(request.form("fname")) response.write(" " & request.form("lname")) %> </body> The browser will display the following in the body of the document: Welcome Bill Gates Form Validation User input should be validated on the browser whenever possible (by client scripts). Browser validation is faster and reduces the server load. You should consider server validation if the user input will be inserted into a database. A good way to validate a form on the server is to post the form to itself, instead of jumping to a different page. The user will then get the error messages on the same page as the form. This makes it easier to discover the error. ❮ Previous Next ❯ COLOR PICKER HOW TO Tabs Dropdowns Accordions Side Navigation Top Navigation Modal Boxes Progress Bars Parallax Login Form HTML Includes Google Maps Range Sliders Tooltips Slideshow Filter List Sort List SHARE CERTIFICATES HTML CSS JavaScript PHP jQuery Bootstrap XML Read More » REPORT ERROR PRINT PAGE FORUM ABOUT × Your Suggestion: Your E-mail: Page address: Description: Submit × Thank You For Helping Us!
