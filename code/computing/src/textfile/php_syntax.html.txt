Basic PHP Syntax A PHP script can be placed anywhere in the document. A PHP script starts with <?php and ends with ?>: <?php // PHP code goes here ?> The default file extension for PHP files is ".php". A PHP file normally contains HTML tags, and some PHP scripting code. Below, we have an example of a simple PHP file, with a PHP script that uses a built-in PHP function "echo" to output the text "Hello World!" on a web page: Example <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <body> <h1>My first PHP page</h1> <?php echo "Hello World!"; ?> </body> </html> Run example » Note: PHP statements end with a semicolon (;). Comments in PHP A comment in PHP code is a line that is not read/executed as part of the program. Its only purpose is to be read by someone who is looking at the code. Comments can be used to: Let others understand what you are doing Remind yourself of what you did - Most programmers have experienced coming back to their own work a year or two later and having to re-figure out what they did. Comments can remind you of what you were thinking when you wrote the code PHP supports several ways of commenting: Example <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <body> <?php // This is a single-line comment # This is also a single-line comment /* This is a multiple-lines comment block that spans over multiple lines */ // You can also use comments to leave out parts of a code line $x = 5 /* + 15 */ + 5; echo $x; ?> </body> </html> Run example » PHP Case Sensitivity In PHP, all keywords (e.g. if, else, while, echo, etc.), classes, functions, and user-defined functions are NOT case-sensitive. In the example below, all three echo statements below are legal (and equal): Example <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <body> <?php ECHO "Hello World!<br>"; echo "Hello World!<br>"; EcHo "Hello World!<br>"; ?> </body> </html> Run example » However; all variable names are case-sensitive. In the example below, only the first statement will display the value of the $color variable (this is because $color, $COLOR, and $coLOR are treated as three different variables): Example <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <body> <?php $color = "red"; echo "My car is " . $color . "<br>"; echo "My house is " . $COLOR . "<br>"; echo "My boat is " . $coLOR . "<br>"; ?> </body> </html> Run example » Test Yourself With Exercises Exercise: Insert the missing part of the code below to output "Hello World". 
 "Hello World";
