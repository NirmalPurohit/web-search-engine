Arrays Arrays are used to store multiple values in one single variable: Example Create an array containing car names: cars = ["Ford", "Volvo", "BMW"] Run example » What is an Array? An array is a special variable, which can hold more than one value at a time. If you have a list of items (a list of car names, for example), storing the cars in single variables could look like this: car1 = "Ford"; car2 = "Volvo"; car3 = "BMW"; However, what if you want to loop through the cars and find a specific one? And what if you had not 3 cars, but 300? The solution is an array! An array can hold many values under a single name, and you can access the values by referring to an index number. Access the Elements of an Array You refer to an array element by referring to the index number. Example Get the value of the first array item: x = cars[0] Run example » Example Modify the value of the first array item: cars[0] = "Toyota" Run example » The Length of an Array Use the len() method to return the length of an array (the number of elements in an array). Example Return the number of elements in the cars array: x = len(cars) Run example » Note: The length of an array is always one more than the highest array index. Looping Array Elements You can use the for in loop to loop through all the elements of an array. Example Print each item in the cars array: for x in cars: print(x) Run example » Adding Array Elements You can use the append() method to add an element to an array. Example Add one more element to the cars array: cars.append("Honda") Run example » Removing Array Elements You can use the pop() method to remove an element from the array. Example Delete the second element of the cars array: cars.pop(1) Run example » You can also use the remove() method to remove an element from the array. Example Delete the element that has the value "Volvo": cars.remove("Volvo") Run example » Note: The remove() method only removes the first occurrence of the specified value. Array Methods Python has a set of built-in methods that you can use on lists/arrays. Method Description append() Adds an element at the end of the list clear() Removes all the elements from the list copy() Returns a copy of the list count() Returns the number of elements with the specified value extend() Add the elements of a list (or any iterable), to the end of the current list index() Returns the index of the first element with the specified value insert() Adds an element at the specified position pop() Removes the element at the specified position remove() Removes the first item with the specified value reverse() Reverses the order of the list sort() Sorts the list Note: Python does not have built-in support for Arrays, but Python Lists can be used instead. ❮ Previous Next ❯ COLOR PICKER HOW TO Tabs Dropdowns Accordions Side Navigation Top Navigation Modal Boxes Progress Bars Parallax Login Form HTML Includes Google Maps Range Sliders Tooltips Slideshow Filter List Sort List SHARE CERTIFICATES HTML CSS JavaScript PHP jQuery Bootstrap XML Read More » REPORT ERROR PRINT PAGE FORUM ABOUT × Your Suggestion: Your E-mail: Page address: Description: Submit × Thank You For Helping Us!
