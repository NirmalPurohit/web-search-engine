In the 1960s, using only computer terminals, this was the only way to interact with computers. In the 1970s an 1980s, command line input was commonly used by Unix systems and PC systems like MS-DOS and Apple DOS. Today, with graphical user interfaces (GUI), most users never use command-line interfaces (CLI). However, CLI is still used by software developers and system administrators to configure computers, install software, and access features that are not available in the graphical interface. Examples The software package manager npm uses command line input to install software: Windows Example C:\>npm install mysoftware Mac OS Example >npm install mysoftware You can navigate your folders (directories) with command line commands: Windows Example C:\Users\myuser>cd ..
