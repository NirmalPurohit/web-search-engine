Responsive Web Design is about making a webside look good on all devices (desktops, tablets, and phones): Setting The Viewport When making responsive web pages, add the following <meta> element to all your web pages: Example <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"> Try it Yourself » Media Queries Media Queries plays an important role in responsive web pages. With media queries you can define different styles for different browser sizes. Example: Resize the browser window to see that the three elements below will display horizontally on large screens and vertically on small screens: Left Main Content Right Example <style> .left, .right { float: left; width: 20%; /* The width is 20%, by default */ } .main { float: left; width: 60%; /* The width is 60%, by default */ } /* Use Media Query to add a breakpoint at 800px: */ @media screen and (max-width:800px) { .left , .main, .right {width:100%;} } </style> Try it Yourself » Learn more about Responsive Web Design at W3Schools' RWD Tutorial Responsive Images Responsive images are images that scale nicely to fit any browser size. When the CSS width property is set to a percentage value, an image will scale up and down when resizing the browser window. This image is responsive: Example <img src="img_girl.jpg" style="width:80%;height:auto;"> Try it Yourself » If the max-width property is set to 100%, the image will scale down if it has to, but never scale up to be larger than its original size: Example <img src="img_girl.jpg" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;"> Try it Yourself » Image Depending on Browser Size The HTML <picture> element allows you to define different images for different browser window sizes. Example <picture> <source srcset="img_smallflower.jpg" media="(max-width: 600px)"> <source srcset="img_flowers.jpg" media="(max-width: 1500px)"> <source srcset="flowers.jpg"> <img src="img_smallflower.jpg" alt="Flowers"> </picture> Try it Yourself » Responsive W3.CSS W3.CSS is a free CSS Framework that offers Responsive Design by default.
