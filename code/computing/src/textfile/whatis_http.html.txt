Clients are often browsers (Chrome, Edge, Safari), but they can be any type of program or device. Servers are most often computers in the cloud. Web Client Cloud Web Server HTTP Request / Response Communication between clients and servers is done by requests and responses: A client (a browser) sends an HTTP request to the web An web server receives the request The server runs an application to process the request The server returns an HTTP response (output) to the browser The client (the browser) receives the response The HTTP Request Circle A typical HTTP request / response circle: The browser requests an HTML page. The server returns an HTML file. The browser requests a style sheet. The server returns a CSS file. The browser requests an JPG image. The server returns a JPG file. The browser requests JavaScript code. The server returns a JS file The browser requests data. The server returns data (in XML or JSON).
