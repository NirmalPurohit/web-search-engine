We group the "inheritance concept" into two categories: subclass (child) - the class that inherits from another class superclass (parent) - the class being inherited from To inherit from a class, use the extends keyword. In the example below, the Car class (subclass) inherits the attributes and methods from the Vehicle class (superclass): Example class Vehicle { protected String brand = "Ford"; // Vehicle attribute public void honk() { // Vehicle method System.out.println("Tuut, tuut!"); } } class Car extends Vehicle { private String modelName = "Mustang"; // Car attribute public static void main(String[] args) { // Create a myCar object Car myCar = new Car(); // Call the honk() method (from the Vehicle class) on the myCar object myCar.honk(); // Display the value of the brand attribute (from the Vehicle class) and the value of the modelName from the Car class System.out.println(myCar.brand + " " + myCar.modelName); } } Run example » Did you notice the protected modifier in Vehicle? We set the brand attribute in Vehicle to a protected access modifier. If it was set to private, the Car class would not be able to access it. Why And When To Use "Inheritance"? - It is useful for code reusability: reuse attributes and methods of an existing class when you create a new class. ❮ Previous Next ❯ COLOR PICKER HOW TO Tabs Dropdowns Accordions Side Navigation Top Navigation Modal Boxes Progress Bars Parallax Login Form HTML Includes Google Maps Range Sliders Tooltips Slideshow Filter List Sort List SHARE CERTIFICATES HTML CSS JavaScript PHP jQuery Bootstrap XML Read More » REPORT ERROR PRINT PAGE FORUM ABOUT × Your Suggestion: Your E-mail: Page address: Description: Submit × Thank You For Helping Us!
