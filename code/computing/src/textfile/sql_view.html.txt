A view contains rows and columns, just like a real table. The fields in a view are fields from one or more real tables in the database. You can add SQL functions, WHERE, and JOIN statements to a view and present the data as if the data were coming from one single table. CREATE VIEW Syntax CREATE VIEW view_name AS SELECT column1, column2, ... FROM table_name WHERE condition; Note: A view always shows up-to-date data! The database engine recreates the data, using the view's SQL statement, every time a user queries a view. SQL CREATE VIEW Examples The following SQL creates a view that shows all customers from Brazil: Example CREATE VIEW [Brazil Customers] AS SELECT CustomerName, ContactName FROM Customers WHERE Country = "Brazil"; Try it Yourself » We can query the view above as follows: Example SELECT * FROM [Brazil Customers]; Try it Yourself » The following SQL creates a view that selects every product in the "Products" table with a price higher than the average price: Example CREATE VIEW [Products Above Average Price] AS SELECT ProductName, Price FROM Products WHERE Price > (SELECT AVG(Price) FROM Products); Try it Yourself » We can query the view above as follows: Example SELECT * FROM [Products Above Average Price]; Try it Yourself » SQL Updating a View A view can be updated with the CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW command. SQL CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW Syntax CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW view_name AS SELECT column1, column2, ... FROM table_name WHERE condition; The following SQL adds the "City" column to the "Brazil Customers" view: Example CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW [Brazil Customers] AS SELECT CustomerName, ContactName, City FROM Customers WHERE Country = "Brazil"; Try it Yourself » SQL Dropping a View A view is deleted with the DROP VIEW command. SQL DROP VIEW Syntax DROP VIEW view_name; The following SQL drops the "Brazil Customers" view: Example DROP VIEW [Brazil Customers]; Try it Yourself » ❮ Previous Next ❯ COLOR PICKER HOW TO Tabs Dropdowns Accordions Side Navigation Top Navigation Modal Boxes Progress Bars Parallax Login Form HTML Includes Google Maps Range Sliders Tooltips Slideshow Filter List Sort List SHARE CERTIFICATES HTML CSS JavaScript PHP jQuery Bootstrap XML Read More » REPORT ERROR PRINT PAGE FORUM ABOUT × Your Suggestion: Your E-mail: Page address: Description: Submit × Thank You For Helping Us!
