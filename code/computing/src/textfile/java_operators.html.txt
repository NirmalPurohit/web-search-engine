The value is called an operand, while the operation (to be performed between the two operands) is defined by an operator: Operand Operator Operand 100 + 50 In the example below, the numbers 100 and 50 are operands, and the + sign is an operator: Example int x = 100 + 50; Run example » Although the + operator is often used to add together two values, like in the example above, it can also be used to add together a variable and a value, or a variable and a variable: Example int sum1 = 100 + 50; // 150 (100 + 50) int sum2 = sum1 + 250; // 400 (150 + 250) int sum3 = sum2 + sum2; // 800 (400 + 400) Run example » Java divides the operators into the following groups: Arithmetic operators Assignment operators Comparison operators Logical operators Bitwise operators Arithmetic Operators Arithmetic operators are used to perform common mathematical operations. Operator Name Description Example Try it + Addition Adds together two values x + y Try it » - Subtraction Subtracts one value from another x - y Try it » * Multiplication Multiplies two values x * y Try it » / Division Divides one value from another x / y Try it » % Modulus Returns the division remainder x % y Try it » ++ Increment Increases the value of a variable by 1 ++x Try it » -- Decrement Decreases the value of a variable by 1 --x Try it » Java Assignment Operators Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables. In the example below, we use the assignment operator (=) to assign the value 10 to a variable called x: Example int x = 10; Try it Yourself » The addition assignment operator (+=) adds a value to a variable: Example int x = 10; x += 5; Try it Yourself » A list of all assignment operators: Operator Example Same As Try it = x = 5 x = 5 Try it » += x += 3 x = x + 3 Try it » -= x -= 3 x = x - 3 Try it » *= x *= 3 x = x * 3 Try it » /= x /= 3 x = x / 3 Try it » %= x %= 3 x = x % 3 Try it » &= x &= 3 x = x & 3 Try it » |= x |= 3 x = x | 3 Try it » ^= x ^= 3 x = x ^ 3 Try it » >>= x >>= 3 x = x >> 3 Try it » <<= x <<= 3 x = x << 3 Try it » Java Comparison Operators Comparison operators are used to compare two values: Operator Name Example Try it == Equal to x == y Try it » != Not equal x != y Try it » > Greater than x > y Try it » < Less than x < y Try it » >= Greater than or equal to x >= y Try it » <= Less than or equal to x <= y Try it » Java Logical Operators Logical operators are used to determine the logic between variables or values: Operator Name Description Example Try it && Logical and Returns true if both statements are true x < 5 && x < 10 Try it » || Logical or Returns true if one of the statements is true x < 5 || x < 4 Try it » ! Logical not Reverse the result, returns false if the result is true !(x < 5 ! && x < 10) Try it » ❮ Previous Next ❯ COLOR PICKER HOW TO Tabs Dropdowns Accordions Side Navigation Top Navigation Modal Boxes Progress Bars Parallax Login Form HTML Includes Google Maps Range Sliders Tooltips Slideshow Filter List Sort List SHARE CERTIFICATES HTML CSS JavaScript PHP jQuery Bootstrap XML Read More » REPORT ERROR PRINT PAGE FORUM ABOUT × Your Suggestion: Your E-mail: Page address: Description: Submit × Thank You For Helping Us!
