JavaScript Properties Properties are the values associated with a JavaScript object. A JavaScript object is a collection of unordered properties. Properties can usually be changed, added, and deleted, but some are read only. Accessing JavaScript Properties The syntax for accessing the property of an object is: objectName.property // person.age or objectName["property"] // person["age"] or objectName[expression] // x = "age"; person[x] The expression must evaluate to a property name. Example 1 person.firstname + " is " + person.age + " years old."; Try it Yourself » Example 2 person["firstname"] + " is " + person["age"] + " years old."; Try it Yourself » JavaScript for...in Loop The JavaScript for...in statement loops through the properties of an object. Syntax for (variable in object) { code to be executed } The block of code inside of the for...in loop will be executed once for each property. Looping through the properties of an object: Example var person = {fname:"John", lname:"Doe", age:25}; for (x in person) { txt += person[x]; } Try it Yourself » Adding New Properties You can add new properties to an existing object by simply giving it a value. Assume that the person object already exists - you can then give it new properties: Example person.nationality = "English"; Try it Yourself » You cannot use reserved words for property (or method) names. JavaScript naming rules apply. Deleting Properties The delete keyword deletes a property from an object: Example var person = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe", age:50, eyeColor:"blue"}; delete person.age; // or delete person["age"]; Try it Yourself » The delete keyword deletes both the value of the property and the property itself. After deletion, the property cannot be used before it is added back again. The delete operator is designed to be used on object properties. It has no effect on variables or functions. The delete operator should not be used on predefined JavaScript object properties. It can crash your application. Property Attributes All properties have a name. In addition they also have a value. The value is one of the property's attributes. Other attributes are: enumerable, configurable, and writable. These attributes define how the property can be accessed (is it readable?, is it writable?) In JavaScript, all attributes can be read, but only the value attribute can be changed (and only if the property is writable). ( ECMAScript 5 has methods for both getting and setting all property attributes) Prototype Properties JavaScript objects inherit the properties of their prototype. The delete keyword does not delete inherited properties, but if you delete a prototype property, it will affect all objects inherited from the prototype. ❮ Previous Next ❯ COLOR PICKER HOW TO Tabs Dropdowns Accordions Side Navigation Top Navigation Modal Boxes Progress Bars Parallax Login Form HTML Includes Google Maps Range Sliders Tooltips Slideshow Filter List Sort List SHARE CERTIFICATES HTML CSS JavaScript PHP jQuery Bootstrap XML Read More » REPORT ERROR PRINT PAGE FORUM ABOUT × Your Suggestion: Your E-mail: Page address: Description: Submit × Thank You For Helping Us!
