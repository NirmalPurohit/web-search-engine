Almost everything in Python is an object, with its properties and methods. A Class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects. Create a Class To create a class, use the keyword class: Example Create a class named MyClass, with a property named x: class MyClass: x = 5 Run example » Create Object Now we can use the class named myClass to create objects: Example Create an object named p1, and print the value of x: p1 = MyClass() print(p1.x) Run example » The __init__() Function The examples above are classes and objects in their simplest form, and are not really useful in real life applications. To understand the meaning of classes we have to understand the built-in __init__() function. All classes have a function called __init__(), which is always executed when the class is being initiated. Use the __init__() function to assign values to object properties, or other operations that are necessary to do when the object is being created: Example Create a class named Person, use the __init__() function to assign values for name and age: class Person: def __init__(self, name, age): self.name = name self.age = age p1 = Person("John", 36) print(p1.name) print(p1.age) Run example » Note: The __init__() function is called automatically every time the class is being used to create a new object. Object Methods Objects can also contain methods. Methods in objects are functions that belongs to the object. Let us create a method in the Person class: Example Insert a function that prints a greeting, and execute it on the p1 object: class Person: def __init__(self, name, age): self.name = name self.age = age def myfunc(self): print("Hello my name is " + self.name) p1 = Person("John", 36) p1.myfunc() Run example » Note: The self parameter is a reference to the class instance itself, and is used to access variables that belongs to the class. The self Parameter The self parameter is a reference to the class itself, and is used to access variables that belongs to the class. It does not have to be named self , you can call it whatever you like, but it has to be the first parameter of any function in the class: Example Use the words mysillyobject and abc instead of self: class Person: def __init__(mysillyobject, name, age): mysillyobject.name = name mysillyobject.age = age def myfunc(abc): print("Hello my name is " + abc.name) p1 = Person("John", 36) p1.myfunc() Run example » Modify Object Properties You can modify properties on objects like this: Example Set the age of p1 to 40: p1.age = 40 Run example » Delete Object Properties You can delete properties on objects by using the del keyword: Example Delete the age property from the p1 object: del p1.age Run example » Delete Objects You can delete objects by using the del keyword: Example Delete the p1 object: del p1 Run example » ❮ Previous Next ❯ COLOR PICKER HOW TO Tabs Dropdowns Accordions Side Navigation Top Navigation Modal Boxes Progress Bars Parallax Login Form HTML Includes Google Maps Range Sliders Tooltips Slideshow Filter List Sort List SHARE CERTIFICATES HTML CSS JavaScript PHP jQuery Bootstrap XML Read More » REPORT ERROR PRINT PAGE FORUM ABOUT × Your Suggestion: Your E-mail: Page address: Description: Submit × Thank You For Helping Us!
