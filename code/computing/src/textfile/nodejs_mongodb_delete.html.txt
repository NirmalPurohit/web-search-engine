The first parameter of the deleteOne() method is a query object defining which document to delete. Note: If the query finds more than one document, only the first occurrence is deleted. Example Delete the document with the address "Mountain 21": var MongoClient = require('mongodb').MongoClient; var url = "mongodb://localhost:27017/"; MongoClient.connect(url, function(err, db) { if (err) throw err; var dbo = db.db("mydb"); var myquery = { address: 'Mountain 21' }; dbo.collection("customers").deleteOne(myquery, function(err, obj) { if (err) throw err; console.log("1 document deleted"); db.close(); }); }); Run example » Save the code above in a file called "demo_delete.js" and run the file: Run "demo_delete.js" C:\Users\Your Name>node demo_delete.js Which will give you this result: 1 record deleted Delete Many To delete more than one document, use the deleteMany() method. The first parameter of the deleteMany() method is a query object defining which documents to delete. Example Delete all documents were the address starts with the letter "O": var MongoClient = require('mongodb').MongoClient; var url = "mongodb://localhost:27017/"; MongoClient.connect(url, function(err, db) { if (err) throw err; var dbo = db.db("mydb"); var myquery = { address: /^O/ }; dbo.collection("customers").deleteMany(myquery, function(err, obj) { if (err) throw err; console.log(obj.result.n + " document(s) deleted"); db.close(); }); }); Run example » Save the code above in a file called "demo_delete_many.js" and run the file: Run "demo_delete_many.js" C:\Users\Your Name>node demo_delete_many.js Which will give you this result: 2 document(s) deleted The Result Object The deleteMany() method returns an object which contains information about how the execution affected the database. Most of the information is not important to understand, but one object inside the object is called "result" which tells us if the execution went OK, and how many documents were affected. The result object looks like this: { n: 2, ok: 1 } You can use this object to return the number of deleted documents: Example Return the number of deleted documents: console.log(obj.result.n); Which will produce this result: 2 ❮ Previous Next ❯ COLOR PICKER HOW TO Tabs Dropdowns Accordions Side Navigation Top Navigation Modal Boxes Progress Bars Parallax Login Form HTML Includes Google Maps Range Sliders Tooltips Slideshow Filter List Sort List SHARE CERTIFICATES HTML CSS JavaScript PHP jQuery Bootstrap XML Read More » REPORT ERROR PRINT PAGE FORUM ABOUT × Your Suggestion: Your E-mail: Page address: Description: Submit × Thank You For Helping Us!
