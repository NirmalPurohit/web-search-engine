The CSS clear property specifies what elements can float beside the cleared element and on which side. The float Property The float property is used for positioning and formatting content e.g. let an image float left to the text in a container. The float property can have one of the following values: left - The element floats to the left of its container right- The element floats to the right of its container none - The element does not float (will be displayed just where it occurs in the text). This is default inherit - The element inherits the float value of its parent In its simplest use, the float property can be used to wrap text around images. Example - float: right; The following example specifies that an image should float to the right in a text: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Phasellus imperdiet, nulla et dictum interdum, nisi lorem egestas odio, vitae scelerisque enim ligula venenatis dolor. Maecenas nisl est, ultrices nec congue eget, auctor vitae massa. Fusce luctus vestibulum augue ut aliquet. Mauris ante ligula, facilisis sed ornare eu, lobortis in odio. Praesent convallis urna a lacus interdum ut hendrerit risus congue. Nunc sagittis dictum nisi, sed ullamcorper ipsum dignissim ac... Example img { float: right; } Try it Yourself » Example - float: left; The following example specifies that an image should float to the left in a text: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Phasellus imperdiet, nulla et dictum interdum, nisi lorem egestas odio, vitae scelerisque enim ligula venenatis dolor. Maecenas nisl est, ultrices nec congue eget, auctor vitae massa. Fusce luctus vestibulum augue ut aliquet. Mauris ante ligula, facilisis sed ornare eu, lobortis in odio. Praesent convallis urna a lacus interdum ut hendrerit risus congue. Nunc sagittis dictum nisi, sed ullamcorper ipsum dignissim ac... Example img { float: left; } Try it Yourself » Example - No float In the following example the image will be displayed just where it occurs in the text (float: none;): Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Phasellus imperdiet, nulla et dictum interdum, nisi lorem egestas odio, vitae scelerisque enim ligula venenatis dolor. Maecenas nisl est, ultrices nec congue eget, auctor vitae massa. Fusce luctus vestibulum augue ut aliquet. Mauris ante ligula, facilisis sed ornare eu, lobortis in odio. Praesent convallis urna a lacus interdum ut hendrerit risus congue. Nunc sagittis dictum nisi, sed ullamcorper ipsum dignissim ac... Example img { float: none; } Try it Yourself » The clear Property The clear property specifies what elements can float beside the cleared element and on which side. The clear property can have one of the following values: none - Allows floating elements on both sides. This is default left - No floating elements allowed on the left side right- No floating elements allowed on the right side both - No floating elements allowed on either the left or the right side inherit - The element inherits the clear value of its parent The most common way to use the clear property is after you have used a float property on an element. When clearing floats, you should match the clear to the float: If an element is floated to the left, then you should clear to the left. Your floated element will continue to float, but the cleared element will appear below it on the web page. The following example clears the float to the left. Means that no floating elements are allowed on the left side (of the div): Example div { clear: left; } Try it Yourself » The clearfix Hack If an element is taller than the element containing it, and it is floated, it will "overflow" outside of its container: Without Clearfix With Clearfix Then we can add overflow: auto; to the containing element to fix this problem: Example .clearfix { overflow: auto; } Try it Yourself » The overflow: auto clearfix works well as long as you are able to keep control of your margins and padding (else you might see scrollbars). The new, modern clearfix hack however, is safer to use, and the following code is used for most webpages: Example .clearfix::after { content: ""; clear: both; display: table; } Try it Yourself » You will learn more about the ::after pseudo-element in a later chapter. Grid of Boxes / Equal Width Boxes Box 1 Box 2 Box 1 Box 2 Box 3 With the float property, it is easy to float boxes of content side by side: Example * { box-sizing: border-box; } .box { float: left; width: 33.33%; /* three boxes (use 25% for four, and 50% for two, etc) */ padding: 50px; /* if you want space between the images */ } Try it Yourself » What is box-sizing? You can easily create three floating boxes side by side. However, when you add something that enlarges the width of each box (e.g. padding or borders), the box will break. The box-sizing property allows us to include the padding and border in the box's total width (and height), making sure that the padding stays inside of the box and that it does not break. You can read more about the box-sizing property in our CSS Box Sizing Chapter. Images Side By Side The grid of boxes can also be used to display images side by side: Example .img-container { float: left; width: 33.33%; /* three containers (use 25% for four, and 50% for two, etc) */ padding: 5px; /* if you want space between the images */ } Try it Yourself » Equal Height Boxes In the previous example, you learned how to float boxes side by side with an equal width. However, it is not easy to create floating boxes with equal heights. A quick fix however, is to set a fixed height, like in the example below: Box 1 Some content, some content, some content Box 2 Some content, some content, some content Some content, some content, some content Some content, some content, some content Example .box { height: 500px; } Try it Yourself » However, this is not very flexible. It is ok if you can guarantee that the boxes will always have the same amount of content in them. But many times, the content is not the same. If you try the example above on a mobile phone, you will see that the second box's content will be displayed outside of the box. This is where CSS3 Flexbox comes in handy - as it can automatically stretch boxes to be as long as the longest box: Example Box 1 - This is some text to make sure that the content gets really tall. This is some text to make sure that the content gets really tall. This is some text to make sure that the content gets really tall. Box 2 - My height will follow Box 1. Try it Yourself » The only problem with Flexbox is that it does not work in Internet Explorer 10 or earlier versions. You can read more about the Flexbox Layout Module in our CSS Flexbox Chapter. Navigation Menu Use float with a list of hyperlinks to create a horizontal menu: Example Home News Contact About Try it Yourself » Web Layout Example It is also common to do entire web layouts using the float property: Example .header, .footer { background-color: grey; color: white; padding: 15px; } .column { float: left; padding: 15px; } .clearfix::after { content: ""; clear: both; display: table; } .menu { width: 25%; } .content { width: 75%; } Try it Yourself » More Examples An image with border and margins that floats to the right in a paragraph Let an image float to the right in a paragraph. Add border and margins to the image. An image with a caption that floats to the right Let an image with a caption float to the right. Let the first letter of a paragraph float to the left Let the first letter of a paragraph float to the left and style the letter. Creating a website with float Use float to create a homepage with a navbar, header, footer, left content and main content.
